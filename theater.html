    <h3>Name of the Play : Uncle Vanya</h3>
    <h3>Author : Anton Pavlovich Chekhov</h3>
    <p class="direction">Enter VOITSKI from the house. He has been asleep after dinner and
        looks rather dishevelled. He sits down on the bench and straightens his
        collar.
    </p>
    <h5 class="voitski">VOITSKI</h5> 
    <p class="speech">H'm. Yes. [A pause] Yes.</p>
    <h5 class="astroff">ASTROFF</h5> 
    <p class="speech">Have you been asleep?</p>
    <h5 class="voitski">VOITSKI</h5>    
    <p class="speech">
        Yes, very much so. [He yawns] Ever since the Professor and his
        wife have come, our daily life seems to have jumped the track. I sleep
        at the wrong time, drink wine, and eat all sorts of messes for luncheon
        and dinner. It isn't wholesome. Sonia and I used to work together and
        never had an idle moment, but now Sonia works alone and I only eat and
        drink and sleep. Something is wrong.
    </p>
    <h5 class="marina">MARINA</h5>
    <p class="direction">[Shaking her head]</p>
    <p class="speech">Such a confusion in the house! The Professor
        gets up at twelve, the samovar is kept boiling all the morning, and
        everything has to wait for him. Before they came we used to have dinner
        at one o'clock, like everybody else, but now we have it at seven. The
        Professor sits up all night writing and reading, and suddenly, at two
        o'clock, there goes the bell! Heavens, what is that? The Professor wants
        some tea! Wake the servants, light the samovar! Lord, what disorder
    </p>
    <h5 class="astroff">ASTROFF</h5>
    <p class="speech">Will they be here long?</p>
    <h5 class="voitski">VOITSKI</h5>
    <p class="speech">
       A hundred years! The Professor has decided to make his home here.
    </p>
    <h5 class="marina">MARINA</h5>
    <p class="speech">Look at this now! The samovar has been on the table for two hours, and they are all out walking!</p>
    <h5 class="voitski">VOITSKI</h5>
    <p class="speech">All right, don't get excited; here they come.</p>
    <p class="direction">Voices are heard approaching. SEREBRAKOFF, HELENA, SONIA, and TELEGIN come in from the depths of the garden, returning from their walk.</p>
    <h5 class="serebrakoff">SEREBRAKOFF</h5>
    <p class="speech">Superb! Superb! What beautiful views!</p>
    <h5 class="telegin">TELEGIN</h5>
    <p class="speech">They are wonderful, your Excellency.</p>
    <h5 class="sonia">SONIA</h5>
    <p class="speech">To-morrow we shall go into the woods, shall we, papa?</p>
    <h5 class="voitski">VOITSKI</h5>
    <p class="speech">Ladies and gentlemen, tea is ready.</p>
    <h5 class="serebrakoff">SEREBRAKOFF</h5>
    <p class="speech">Won't you please be good enough to send my tea into the library? I still have some work to finish.</p>
    <h5 class="sonia">SONIA</h5>
    <p class="speech">I am sure you will love the woods.</p>
    <p class="direction">HELENA, SEREBRAKOFF, and SONIA go into the house. TELEGIN sits down at the table beside MARINA.</p>
    <h5 class="voitski">VOITSKI</h5>
    <p class="speech">There goes our learned scholar on a hot, sultry day like this, in his overcoat and goloshes and carrying an umbrella!</p>
    <h5 class="astroff">ASTROFF</h5>
    <p class="speech">He is trying to take good care of his health.</p>
    <h5 class="voitski">VOITSKI</h5>
    <p class="speech">How lovely she is! How lovely! I have never in my life seen a more beautiful woman.</p>
    <h5 class="telegin">TELEGIN</h5>
    <p class="speech">Do you know, Marina, that as I walk in the fields or in the shady garden, as I look at this table here, my heart swells withunbounded happiness.
       The weather is enchanting, the birds are singing, we are all living in peace and contentment--what more could the souldesire? [Takes a glass of tea.]
    </p>
    <h5 class="voitski">VOITSKI</h5>
    <p class="direction">[Dreaming]</p>
    <p class="speech">Such eyes--a glorious woman!</p>
    <h5 class="astroff">ASTROFF</h5>
    <p class="speech">Come, Ivan, tell us something.</p>
    <h5 class="voitski">VOITSKI</h5>
    <p class="direction">[Indolently]</p>
    <p class="speech">What shall I tell you?</p>
    <h5 class="astroff">ASTROFF</h5>
    <p class="speech">Haven't you any news for us?</p>
    <h5 class="voitski">VOITSKI</h5>
    <p class="speech">No, it is all stale.
        I am just the same as usual, or perhaps worse, because I have become lazy. 
        I don't do anything now but croak like an old raven. 
        My mother, the old magpie, is still chattering about the emancipation of woman, with one eye on her grave and the other on her learned books, in which she is always looking for the dawn of a new life.
    </p>
    <h5 class="astroff">ASTROFF</h5>
    <p class="speech">And the Professor?</p>
    <h5 class="voitski">VOITSKI</h5>
    <p class="speech">The Professor sits in his library from morning till night, asusual--
        
           "Straining the mind, wrinkling the brow,
            We write, write, write,
            Without respite
            Or hope of praise in the future or now."
    </p>
     <p class="direction">Poor paper! He ought to write his autobiography; he would make a
        really splendid subject for a book! Imagine it, the life of a retired
        professor, as stale as a piece of hardtack, tortured by gout, headaches,
        and rheumatism, his liver bursting with jealousy and envy, living on the
        estate of his first wife, although he hates it, because he can't afford
        to live in town. He is everlastingly whining about his hard lot, though,
        as a matter of fact, he is extraordinarily lucky. He is the son of
        a common deacon and has attained the professor's chair, become the
        son-in-law of a senator, is called "your Excellency," and so on. But
        I'll tell you something; the man has been writing on art for twenty-five
        years, and he doesn't know the very first thing about it. For
        twenty-five years he has been chewing on other men's thoughts about
        realism, naturalism, and all such foolishness; for twenty-five years he
        has been reading and writing things that clever men have long known and
        stupid ones are not interested in; for twenty-five years he has been
        making his imaginary mountains out of molehills. And just think of the
        man's self-conceit and presumption all this time! For twenty-five years
        he has been masquerading in false clothes and has now retired absolutely
        unknown to any living soul; and yet see him! stalking across the earth
        like a demi-god!
